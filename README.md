## Description

This project is intended for the subject of Fundamentals of Computer Engineering. On this website you can find information about me, a contact mailbox, information about the double degree that I am studying, the link to my classmates websites and the most important page, the topic. The topic is about the future of medicine in order to inform young people about the future medical technologies that will take care of us in our lives.

## Problems

Durante el desarrollo de este website me he encontrado pobremas como:
  - Difficulties with the use of git and the repository: At first, everything gave me an error and the repository wasn't updated, this was because all the git commands were being done on an incorrect branch, so using the cd and cd .. commands, I managed to get to the right branch and be able to update my repository
  - Problems when placing images: Not knowing how to use the "float" tool, made me place the images using margins and inefficient and very tedious tools. Once I discovered how to float the elements everything was easier.
  - Problems with the nav addresses: Since the public pages are one level below index, when it came to copying the index template the navigation menu didn't work. I managed to fix it by using the commands ../ to go to the previous level / to go to the main branch, ./ or nothing to reference that same folder and # to reference itself.

## Conclusions

In summary, this web project has played a pivotal role in deepening my comprehension of HTML, CSS, and the comprehensive workings of the repository and Git system. The hands-on experience has equipped me with practical insights into structuring web content, refining styling with CSS, and effectively utilizing Git for version control in collaborative settings. The encountered challenges have honed my troubleshooting skills, contributing to a more robust understanding of web development best practices.

Looking forward, I am optimistic that the knowledge gained will empower me to tackle more intricate projects in the future. I aspire to apply these newfound skills to develop innovative and seamlessly functional web projects, integrating design aesthetics with efficient version control practices. In essence, this project has not only expanded my technical prowess but also instilled confidence in my ability to navigate and contribute meaningfully to the evolving landscape of web development.
